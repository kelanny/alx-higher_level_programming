Use “container-on-demand” to run MySQL
In the container, credentials are root/root

Ask for container Ubuntu 20.04
Connect via SSH
OR connect via the Web terminal
In the container, you should start MySQL before playing with it:
$ service mysql start                                                   
 * Starting MySQL database server mysqld 
$
$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -uroot -p                               
Database                                                                                   
information_schema                                                                         
mysql                                                                                      
performance_schema                                                                         
sys

In the container, credentials are root/root
