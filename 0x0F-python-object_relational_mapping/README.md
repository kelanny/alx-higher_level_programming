Background Context
In this project, you will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, you will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, you will use the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”. You won’t write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code won’t be “storage type” dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.


Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
Why Python programming is awesome
How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
What ORM means
How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
How to create a Python Virtual Environment

More Info
Install and activate venv
To create a Python Virtual Environment, allowing you to install specific dependencies for this python project, we will install venv:

$ sudo apt-get install python3.8-venv
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
Install MySQLdb module version 2.0.x
For installing MySQLdb, you need to have MySQL installed: How to install MySQL 8.0 in Ubuntu 20.04

$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
$ sudo pip3 install mysqlclient
...
$ python3
>>> import MySQLdb
>>> MySQLdb.version_info 
(2, 0, 3, 'final', 0)
Install SQLAlchemy module version 1.4.x
$ sudo pip3 install SQLAlchemy
...
$ python3
>>> import sqlalchemy
>>> sqlalchemy.__version__ 
'1.4.22' 

Tasks
0. Get all states
mandatory
Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


1. Filter states
mandatory
Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


2. Filter states by user input
mandatory
Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name searched (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
You must use format to create the SQL query with the user input
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


3. SQL Injection...
mandatory
Wait, do you remember the previous task? Did you test "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '" as an input?


4. Cities by states
mandatory
Write a script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id
You can use only execute() once
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


5. All cities by state
mandatory
Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database hbtn_0e_4_usa

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name (SQL injection free!)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id
You can use only execute() once
The results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported
